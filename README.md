# Documentation for Portfolio Website App (portfolio-website)
This is a NextJS application that provides various features such as contact form, portfolio showcase and more to users while also providing SEO optimization with Nodemailer library which allows you send emails from your app using Node.js in the backend without having access to any client side code or server logs (like sending email through SMTP).
## Installation 
To start this project locally:
```bash
npm install -g create-next-app # if not installed already, globally installing next js and creating a new app using npm.
npx create-next-app@latest portfolio-website --use-npm // or use yarn as well (yarn add create-next-app)  to setup the project with default configuration for NextJS application in your current directory named 'portfolio-website'. Then navigate into this app using npm run dev.
```  
## Features:    
1. **Contact Form** - Users can fill out a form on our website and send their messages through email to us (using Nodemailer). 
2. **Portfolio Showcase**- A showcasing of various projects that we have worked upon in the past, including both personal work samples as well as professional ones such as websites or apps developed by companies like Google/Facebook etc..  
3. SEO Optimization - We use NextJS's server side rendering and static site generation to provide a fast initial page load with optimized performance for search engines (SEO). 
4. **Responsive Design**- The website is designed using Tailwind CSS, an utility first css framework which allows you create custom designs without worrying about the underlying styles or layout system of your project/website design tool like Figma etc..  
5. Email Sending - Using Nodemailer library to send emails from our app backend (NodeJS). 
6. **Backend API**- We provide a RESTful api for front end developers, allowing them fetch data or perform actions on the server side without needing any client code changes/server logs accessibility etc..  
7. Cross Browser Compatible - The website is built using modern CSS properties and flexbox layout which ensures compatibility across different browsers (like Chrome / Firefox). 
8. **SEO Optimized**- We use Google's PageSpeed Insights to optimize our site for better performance on search engines, improving the user experience of your web page load time in seconds by serving up a faster website than usual and thus increasing visibility into users’ interest via organic traffic from mobile devices (like Android/iOS).
9. **Analytics** - We use Google Analytic's to track how visitors are interacting with our site, what pages they visit etc., helping us understand user behavior better which can be used for future enhancements or feature improvements in the website itself.. 
10. Easy To Maintain and Update- Our team is highly skilled at maintaining codebase as per best practices of software development to ensure smooth operations on this platform over time, with a focus towards providing high quality services while keeping upstream support from our users who use it for their work or learning purposes etc..
